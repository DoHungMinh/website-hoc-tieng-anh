The Wind and the Sun

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:07,278
(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,511
The [[wind and the sun]] are having a disagreement. 

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:16,906
"I am the most powerful!" says the wind.

5
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:21,530
"No, I am the most powerful!" says the sun.

6
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:26,539
"I can blow trees to the ground!" brags the wind.

7
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,802
"I can push ships across the ocean.

8
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,889
I can make hurricanes and [[tornadoes]]!" 

9
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,586
"Is that right?" replies the sun.

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:43,057
"Well, I can melt all the snow on the mountains.

11
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:46,296
I can dry up an entire lake.

12
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,291
I can make a [[sidewalk]] so hot

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,291
that it cooks an egg!"

14
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:58,913
Just then, they see a man walking
along the road in his winter jacket .

15
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:04,508
"Let's have a contest to see who
is more powerful," says the wind.

16
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:09,265
"Whoever can remove the man's jacket first wins." 

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,632
[[The sun agrees]].

18
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind goes first.

19
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:17,843
He blows a gust of cold wind at the man. 

20
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,000
The man shivers and zips up his jacket.

21
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:25,884
"Brrr! What a cold and windy day!" 

22
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,149
It starts to rain.

23
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:32,399
The wind blows even harder and
turns the rain into [[snow]].

24
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:37,746
"Well look at that! It's snowing!" says the man.

25
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:41,090
"Snow wasn't in the weather forecast today..."

26
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:43,914
He pulls his hood over his head.

27
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:48,487
The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man,

28
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,260
but the man's jacket stays on.

29
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,236
"Hmm. It's a bit [[fresh]] today…" he says.

30
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,000
"A winter storm must be coming..."

31
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:01,618
He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose.

32
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:06,693
"Gah! This is impossible," says the wind.

33
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,693
He stops blowing.

34
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,864
"My turn!" says the sun. 

35
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:16,176
First the sun [[shines]] enough to stop the snow.

36
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,161
The man unzips his hood.

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,482
Then the sun pulls the clouds apart
and gently shines down on the man.

38
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:29,924
Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day.

39
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:36,132
"Wow. The weather sure is strange
around here!" says the man.

40
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,264
He unzips his [[jacket]]. 

41
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:44,673
The sun gently wiggles her fingers
and increases the temperature. 

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,274
"What strange weather. Now it feels like summer!"

43
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:52,878
the man says as he begins to sweat.

44
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,517
"Goodness me, it's so hot!"

45
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,873
He removes his winter jacket.

46
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:04,174
He lies down on the [[grass]] for a
nap in the warm sun.

47
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:08,661
"I win!" says the sun, beaming.  

48
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:10,413
Moral:

49
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:16,580
Sometimes warmth and gentleness can
achieve more than strength and force.`;

The Fox and the Crow

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,487
(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:13,037
Early one morning, a fox is
walking through the woods.

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:16,757
He is [[hungry]], and he is
looking for something to eat.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,000
He sees a crow sitting on the
highest branch of a tree.

6
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:24,865
The crow has a piece of cheese
in her beak.

7
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:30,230
"Mmm… I love cheese!" thinks the fox.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,007
"I think I've found my breakfast!

9
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:35,820
But how can I get the [[cheese]]?"

10
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,426
‍He thinks and he thinks.

11
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:42,524
Then he has a clever idea.

12
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:46,218
"I will make her talk!"

13
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:52,587
He sits at the bottom of the
tree and looks up at the crow.

14
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:56,583
"[[Good morning]], Miss Crow!" he says.

15
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,905
"It's a lovely day, isn't it?"

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,089
‍The crow looks down at the fox.

17
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,071
She says nothing.

18
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:09,205
"I said, good morning!" says the fox.

19
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:14,118
"Did you hear me? Maybe you
can't hear me up there..."

20
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:16,347
‍The crow is [[suspicious]].

21
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:21,368
She holds the cheese tightly
in her beak and says nothing.

22
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,555
"Hmm. This is not so easy,"
thinks the fox.

23
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:27,909
But he doesn't give up.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,757
He smiles at the crow.

25
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:36,744
"You know…  you really are
the most beautiful bird," he says.

26
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,047
Your feathers are so shiny!

27
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:43,123
Your eyes are so [[intelligent]]!

28
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:47,737
Your beak is so…umm…  pointy!

29
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:51,263
Everything about you is perfect!"

30
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,321
Still, the crow says nothing.

31
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:58,485
So the fox says: "Tell me, Miss Crow…

32
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:01,698
is your voice ALSO magnificent?

33
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:05,208
I hear that you have the
most wonderful voice.

34
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:09,236
Please sing for me! Just one song!

35
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:14,018
Then I can tell everyone you really
are the most incredible bird —

36
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:17,673
— the queen of all birds, in fact!"

37
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,901
This makes the crow feel good.

38
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:24,713
She wants everyone to know
she has a [[wonderful voice]].

39
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:29,648
She wants everyone to know
that she is the queen of all birds.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,395
She smiles a little smile.

41
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,833
Then she smiles a big smile.

42
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:41,388
Then she opens her mouth to sing
her best song for the fox.

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
And… plop!

44
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:49,312
The cheese drops out of her beak and
falls straight into the [[mouth of the fox]].

45
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:52,144
He swallows it in one gulp.

46
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,862
"MMmmmmm!"

47
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,412
"Thank you for the delicious
breakfast, Miss Crow!"

48
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,736
laughs the fox as he [[walks away]].

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,351
"Have a lovely day!"

50
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:07,608
Moral:

51
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,199
Beware of flatterers.

52
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,049
They often want something from you.`;

(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:13,902
Everybody knows that bears love honey.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,254
One day Mr Bear [[looks in his cupboard]]
and he can't find any honey.

5
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,783
"Oh no! No honey!" he says.

6
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:30,510
So he goes into the forest to find some.

7
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,230
He sees a beehive in a tree.

8
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,834
He smells the honey.

9
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:41,739
"Mmmmm! [[Honey]]!"

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,876
He sticks his paw into the beehive and…

11
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,961
ZZZZZZZZZ!

12
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,961
A bee flies out.

13
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:54,313
"Hey, bear! Go away!" says the bee.

14
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,843
"This is not your honey!"

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Mr Bear is [[annoyed]].

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,429
"I am bigger than you," he says.

17
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:06,478
"And I am stronger than you too.

18
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,595
I can do what I want!

19
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:10,182
Now... buzz off!"

20
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:15,043
Mr Bear [[sticks his paw into the beehive]] again and…

00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:18,706
ZZZZZZZZZ!  ZING!

22
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:19,911
OWIE!

23
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:23,627
The bee stings him right on his nose!

24
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,951
"My nose! My nose!

25
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,662
Oooh... I'm so angry!" growls Mr Bear.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,912
He [[finds a big stick]].

27
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,399
He tries to hit the bee.

28
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,407
He swings and he swings,
but the bee is too fast!

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,473
Mr Bear gets angrier and angrier.

30

"GARRRRRGHH! I WILL SQUASH YOU!

31

"AH HAH! Now you're trapped!" yells Mr Bear.

33
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,900

00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,239

36
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,764

Thousands of bees fly out
of the smashed beehive.

40
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:30,236
They fly around Mr Bear's head…

41
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,732
ZZZZZZZZZ… ZING!

42
