The Wind and the Sun

2
00:00:03,802 --> 00:00:07,278
(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,511
The [[wind and the sun]] are having a disagreement. 

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:16,906
"I am the most powerful!" says the wind.

5
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:21,530
"No, I am the most powerful!" says the sun.

6
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:26,539
"I can blow trees to the ground!" brags the wind.

7
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,802
"I can push ships across the ocean.

8
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,889
I can make hurricanes and [[tornadoes]]!" 

9
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,586
"Is that right?" replies the sun.

10
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:43,057
"Well, I can melt all the snow on the mountains.

11
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:46,296
I can dry up an entire lake.

12
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,291
I can make a [[sidewalk]] so hot

13
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,291
that it cooks an egg!"

14
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:58,913
Just then, they see a man walking
along the road in his winter jacket .

15
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:04,508
"Let's have a contest to see who
is more powerful," says the wind.

16
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:09,265
"Whoever can remove the man's jacket first wins." 

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,632
[[The sun agrees]].

18
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind goes first.

19
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:17,843
He blows a gust of cold wind at the man. 

20
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,000
The man shivers and zips up his jacket.

21
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:25,884
"Brrr! What a cold and windy day!" 

22
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:28,149
It starts to rain.

23
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:32,399
The wind blows even harder and
turns the rain into [[snow]].

24
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:37,746
"Well look at that! It's snowing!" says the man.

25
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:41,090
"Snow wasn't in the weather forecast today..."

26
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:43,914
He pulls his hood over his head.

27
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:48,487
The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man,

28
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,260
but the man's jacket stays on.

29
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:55,236
"Hmm. It's a bit [[fresh]] today…" he says.

30
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,000
"A winter storm must be coming..."

31
00:01:58,193 --> 00:02:01,618
He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose.

32
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:06,693
"Gah! This is impossible," says the wind.

33
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,693
He stops blowing.

34
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,864
"My turn!" says the sun. 

35
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:16,176
First the sun [[shines]] enough to stop the snow.

36
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:19,161
The man unzips his hood.

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,482
Then the sun pulls the clouds apart
and gently shines down on the man.

38
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:29,924
Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day.

39
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:36,132
"Wow. The weather sure is strange
around here!" says the man.

40
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,264
He unzips his [[jacket]]. 

41
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:44,673
The sun gently wiggles her fingers
and increases the temperature. 

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,274
"What strange weather. Now it feels like summer!"

43
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:52,878
the man says as he begins to sweat.

44
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,517
"Goodness me, it's so hot!"

45
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,873
He removes his winter jacket.

46
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:04,174
He lies down on the [[grass]] for a
nap in the warm sun.

47
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:08,661
"I win!" says the sun, beaming.  

48
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:10,413
Moral:

49
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:16,580
Sometimes warmth and gentleness can
achieve more than strength and force.`;
