The Bear and the Bee

2
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:08,235
(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:13,902
Everybody knows that bears love honey.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,254
One day Mr Bear [[looks in his cupboard]]
and he can't find any honey.

5
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,783
"Oh no! No honey!" he says.

6
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:30,510
So he goes into the forest to find some.

7
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,230
He sees a beehive in a tree.

8
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:38,834
He smells the honey.

9
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:41,739
"Mmmmm! [[Honey]]!"

10
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,876
He sticks his paw into the beehive and…

11
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,961
ZZZZZZZZZ!

12
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:49,961
A bee flies out.

13
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:54,313
“Hey, bear! Go away!” says the bee.

14
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,843
"This is not your honey!"

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Mr Bear is [[annoyed]].

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,429
“I am bigger than you,” he says.

17
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:06,478
“And I am stronger than you too.

18
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,595
I can do what I want!

19
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:10,182
Now... buzz off!”

20
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:15,043
Mr Bear [[sticks his paw into the beehive]] again and…

21
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:18,706
ZZZZZZZZZ!  ZING!

22
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:19,911
OWIE!

23
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:23,627
The bee stings him right on his nose!

24
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,951
“My nose! My nose!

25
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,662
Oooh... I'm so angry!" growls Mr Bear.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,912
He [[finds a big stick]].

27
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,399
He tries to hit the bee.

28
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,407
He swings and he swings,
but the bee is too fast!

29
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:46,473
Mr Bear gets angrier and angrier.

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,379
"GARRRRRGHH! I WILL SQUASH YOU!
COME HERE!"

31
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:55,216
The bee flies back into the beehive.

32
00:01:56,085 --> 00:02:00,628
"AH HAH! Now you're trapped!" yells Mr Bear.

33
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,900
He [[swings his stick]] at the beehive.

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,593
Smash! Smash! Smash!

35
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,239
He smashes it to pieces!

36
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,764
Then he hears a strange sound.

37
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:16,290
It gets louder and louder…

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,266
ZZZZ! ZZZZ! ZZZ! Zzzz!
ZZZZZZZZZZ! Zzzz! ZZZZ!

39
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:27,198
Thousands of bees fly out
of the smashed beehive.

40
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:30,236
They fly around Mr Bear's head…

41
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,732
ZZZZZZZZZ… ZING!
They sting him on his ear.

42
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:40,094
ZING ZING!
They sting him on [[his elbow]].

43
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:43,217
They chase Mr Bear through the forest.

44
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:47,675
They sting him on his arms,
his legs, his hands...

45
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:50,342
... and especially on his nose.

46
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:51,983
ZING! ZING! ZING!

47
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:58,114
Mr Bear runs all the way home
and slams the door shut. BAM!

48
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,410
Then he hears a voice [[behind]] him.

49
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,527
It’s Mrs. Bear.

50
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:08,339
“You did it again, didn’t you?” she says.

51
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,392
“You lost your temper.”

52
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:16,618
“Yes,” he says as he cries
and counts his bee stings.

53
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:21,265
“Here’s the bee-sting medicine,”
says Mrs. Bear.

54
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:24,049
“Also, we have honey in the [[cupboard]].

55
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,049
It’s behind the flour.”

56
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,587
Moral: A hot temper always
gets you into trouble.
