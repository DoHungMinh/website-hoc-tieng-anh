00:00:00,174 --> 00:00:02,174
The Fox and the Crow

2
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,487
(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:13,037
Early one morning, a fox is
walking through the woods.

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:16,757
He is [[hungry]], and he is
looking for something to eat.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,000
He sees a crow sitting on the
highest branch of a tree.

6
00:00:21,518 --> 00:00:24,865
The crow has a piece of cheese
in her beak.

7
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:30,230
“Mmm… I love cheese!" thinks the fox.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,007
"I think I’ve found my breakfast!

9
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:35,820
But how can I get the [[cheese]]?"

10
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,426
‍He thinks and he thinks.

11
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:42,524
Then he has a clever idea.

12
00:00:43,453 --> 00:00:46,218
"I will make her talk!"

13
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:52,587
He sits at the bottom of the
tree and looks up at the crow.

14
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:56,583
“[[Good morning]], Miss Crow!” he says.

15
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,905
"It’s a lovely day, isn’t it?"

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,089
‍The crow looks down at the fox.

17
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,071
She says nothing.

18
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:09,205
"I said, good morning!" says the fox.

19
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:14,118
"Did you hear me? Maybe you
can't hear me up there...”

20
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:16,347
‍The crow is [[suspicious]].

21
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:21,368
She holds the cheese tightly
in her beak and says nothing.

22
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,555
"Hmm. This is not so easy,"
thinks the fox.

23
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:27,909
But he doesn’t give up.

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,757
He smiles at the crow.

25
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:36,744
“You know…  you really are
the most beautiful bird,” he says.

26
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:40,047
Your feathers are so shiny!

27
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:43,123
Your eyes are so [[intelligent]]!

28
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:47,737
Your beak is so…umm…  pointy!

29
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:51,263
Everything about you is perfect!”

30
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:54,321
Still, the crow says nothing.

31
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:58,485
So the fox says: “Tell me, Miss Crow…

32
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:01,698
is your voice ALSO magnificent?

33
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:05,208
I hear that you have the
most wonderful voice.

34
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:09,236
Please sing for me! Just one song!

35
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:14,018
Then I can tell everyone you really
are the most incredible bird —

36
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:17,673
— the queen of all birds, in fact!”

37
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,901
This makes the crow feel good.

38
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:24,713
She wants everyone to know
she has a [[wonderful voice]].

39
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:29,648
She wants everyone to know
that she is the queen of all birds.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,395
She smiles a little smile.

41
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,833
Then she smiles a big smile.

42
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:41,388
Then she opens her mouth to sing
her best song for the fox.

43
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
And… plop!

44
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:49,312
The cheese drops out of her beak and
falls straight into the [[mouth of the fox]].

45
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:52,144
He swallows it in one gulp.

46
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,862
"MMmmmmm!"

47
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,412
"Thank you for the delicious
breakfast, Miss Crow!"

48
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,736
laughs the fox as he [[walks away]].

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,351
"Have a lovely day!”

50
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:07,608
Moral:

51
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,199
Beware of flatterers.

52
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,049
They often want something from you.
